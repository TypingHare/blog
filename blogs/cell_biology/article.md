All living cells on Earth store their hereditary information in the form of DNA——long, unbranched, paired polymer chains, formed always of the same monomers, known as **nucleotides**. These monomers are strung together in a long linear sequence that encodes the **genetic information**.

A nucleotide consists of two parts: a sugar (**deoxyribose**) with a **phosphate group** attached to it, and a **nitrogenous base**, which may be either adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), or thymine (T). Each sugar is linked to the next via the phosphate group, creating a polymer chain composed of a repetitive sugar-phosphate backbone with a series of bases protruding from it.

The DNA polymer is extended by adding monomers at one end. DNA is not synthesized as a free strand in isolation, but on a template formed by a preexisting DNA strand. The bases on the new strand and the template strand pair up by the complementary rule: _A binds to T_, and _C binds to G_. The new strand grows by following the base-paring rule and picking up next monomers. In this way, a double-stranded structure with complementary sequences is created. The two strands then twist around each other, forming a **DNA double helix**. This process is called **DNA replication**.

In the process of **transcription**, segments of the DNA sequence are used as templates for the synthesis of shorter molecules of the closely related polymer **ribonucleic acid**, or **RNA**. Later, in the more complex process of translation, many of these RNA molecules direct the synthesis of polymers of a radically different chemical class——the **proteins**.

The backbone of RNA is formed by **ribonucleotide**, where sugar is **ribose**. The four bases are uracil (U) in place of thymine (T), but other three bases——A, C, and G——are the same. The outcome of transcription is a polymer molecule whose sequence of nucleotides faithfully represents a portion of the cell's genetic information, though it consists of RNA monomers. They serve as **messenger RNA (mRNA)** molecules that guide the synthesis of proteins according to the genetic instructions stored in the DNA.

There are many different protein molecules in each cell, and they form most of the cell's mass leaving out the water. There are 20 types of monomers of protein, called **amino acids**. An amino acid consists of an amino group, a carboxyl group and a side chain, denoted as "R". Each of the protein molecules is a **polypeptide**, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. By folding into a precise three-dimensional form with **reactive sites** on its surface, these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to **catalyze reactions** that make or break covalent bonds. In addition to catalysis, proteins have many other functions, such as maintaining structures, generating movements, sensing signals, and so on.

The messenger RNA reads out in groups of three nucleotides at a time and each triplet of nucleotides, or **codon**, specifies a single amino acid in a corresponding protein. There are 64 possible codons, but there are only 20 naturally occurring amino acids, which means there are necessarily many cases where several codons correspond to the same amino acid.

The **genetic code** is read out by a special class of small RNA molecules, the **transfer RNA (tRNA)**. Each type of tRNA becomes attached at one end to a specific amino acid, and displays at its other end a specific sequence of three nucleotides——an **anticodon**——that enables it to recognize, through base-paring, a particular codon or subset of codons in mRNA. This intricate chemistry occurs on the **ribosome**, a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and **ribosomal RNA**.
