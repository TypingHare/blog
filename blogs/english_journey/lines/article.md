# Death Note

- But I have to make sure that no one ever finds out that I came into contact with Raye Penber.
- This is the first time I've ever put my life on the line. (这是我第一次冒生命危险)
- I brought my father a change of clothes, but it doesn't look like he's in. Can I leave them here.
- Don't take this the wrong way, but I think that's a bit of a leap of faith. (别误会，但我觉得这不太可信)
- Your testimony could be central to the case (你的证词可能对案件至关重要)
- Didn't you think it odd that there was no one at Task Force headquarters?
- Guess I spoke too soon. She's sharp. (她很敏锐)
- He brought me on board to help out with the investigation. (他邀请我来协助调查)
- Up until three months ago, I worked as an FBI agent.
- So, will a Japanese driver's liscense do the trick then? (那日本驾照可以吗)
- Having said that, just go ahead with it. (话虽如此，继续做吧)
- Now that you mention it, I do remember that.
- But it seems contrived. (但这看起来太做作了)
- It's a little bit complicated, so listen up.
- I wouldn't laugh if I were you. (我是你的话就笑不出来了)
- I've got one finishing touch left to add. (我还有最后一点收尾工作要做)
- I have a good grasp of where all the cameras are placed. (我对所有摄像头的布置位置非常清楚)
- It seemed like he was off in his own world. (他似乎沉浸在自己的世界里)
- In and of itself it won't determine if Light is Kira. (就其本身而言，这并不能决定Light是否キラ)
- This is a token gesture—an elaborate act to go with so we can say we are closer.
- That was well worded. (well worded: 措辞恰当；美其名曰)
- No matter how little he says he suspects me, it means he has grounds to prevent me from meeting anyone on the task force. （have ground to do: 有理由做）
- it was quite a pre-emptive move on this part. (这是一个先发制人的举措)
- He's always quick and to the point.
- If it bleeds, it leads. (如果有血腥，就会上头条)
- There's a very good chance I will die. (有很大可能我会死)
- You litterally took the words right out of my mouth. (你说了我想说的)
- I have chosen to be lenient with him for the time being. 
- I should probably go to Aoyama and Shibuya, since I blend in with the crowd there, you know.
- Don't you believe in love at first sight?
- It begs the question, why didn't he do this to begin with?
- If Light is Kira, I don't think this message he would have had the Second Kira send us.
- Then, deny that they were made contact, letting the second Kira shoulder the blame for my death.
- I'm positive that the real Kira would want L to die. (be positive that 确信)
- I think you're mistaken. (我觉得你说的不对)
-
