# Repentance

Since September 2024, or the beginning of the second semester after transferring to UMass Lowell, I have been trying to avoid thinking in Chinese. At this point, I find myself juggling two different systems for processing spoken English:

1. **Indirect Mode**: I translate everything I hear into Chinese, formulate my response in Chinese, and then translate it back into English.
2. **Direct Mode**: I generate an English response based on the context and express it directly.

While many bilingual English speakers suggest that English learners use a direct mode of thinking, this approach may not be practical for everyone. These bilingual individuals often receive a significant amount of English input from family members, private tutors, and English language schools. In contrast, those who have not had as much exposure may struggle to formulate responses without first translating the content into their native language. This is largely because English learners typically rely on memorized connections between English words or phrases and their translations. As a result, the associations between these lexemes and more abstract concepts can be quite vague or even nonexistent.

Conversely, native speakers and bilinguals have already established numerous connections between words and abstract ideas. When they hear a word, phrase, or opinion, a wealth of relevant lexemes floods their minds. For monolingual individuals, it is difficult to imagine a situation where these connections have not been formed.

Based on my knowledge of neuroscience from various books I've read, I was able to make some deductions shortly after arriving in America. At that time, I created a plan and schedule for learning English. In one of my diary entries, I even declared, "I won't ever read Chinese books, watch Chinese videos, or engage in anything related to Chinese." However, I quickly realized that learning English from scratch is truly exhausting. Building new "memory pegs" requires significant mental energy. To make matters worse, I often struggle with motivation due to personal reasons.

I've been observing individuals who immigrated to America at a young age, and their English proficiency varies significantly. My uncle, who has lived in America for over 30 years, can confidently speak English, but he has a strong accent and struggles with grammar. In contrast, my friend Sun, who moved to America during middle school seven years ago, engages in fluent conversations with native speakers. This disparity suggests that English proficiency is more closely related to the effort put into learning the language than to the length of time spent residing in America.

For immigrants like us, learning a language often feels like a daunting "task," while for native speakers, it is simply part of their "daily life." In the first few years, many immigrants study at community colleges like nocturnal mammals, navigating a world that can feel overwhelming. Native speakers can be like a scorching sun, presenting a harsh challenge, while fellow countrymen are more like the gentle moon, guiding us back to our comfortable nests. I found myself in this position. Despite taking various steps to change my situation, I still struggle to persevere.

Ultimately, I must choose the path I’ll walk: either remain frustrated and discouraged by my lack of fluency in English, or confront the challenges and fears of learning it and embrace the excitement of my transformation.
