## Learning Theory

Schema refers to the organized pattern of thought, such as features of an animal. Accommodating new information is changing a schema. Not all schema is worth for teaching the tutee. Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) refers to things that **student can do with assistance**. The complement of ZPD is "what student can do without assistance" and "what student can't do even with assistance".

Bloom's Taxonomy is a series of thinking skills to figure out what activities can build a schema.

- Remember - Recall information
- Understand - Demonstrate understanding of facts (What is it?)
- Apply - Apply information to actual situation (How to use it?)
- Analyze - Break down information (Why is it?)
- Evaluate - Use criteria to make a judgment (Is it correct? How to test it?)
- Create - Put together information to develop new ideas or critical thinking

Students can't create until they understand. Therefore, use questions and tasks to match what students need to learn at that time.

According to study, positive reinforcement increases the likelihood that a behavior will occur again, increases the time student is willing to spend on a difficult task, and increases sense of self-worth. However, make sure don't overuse positive reinforcement, and let students work independently. Moreover, praise their behaviors instead of their personalities.

Human beings have multiple types of intelligence, including:

- Linguistic intelligence - The ability to effectively use language
- Logical/mathematical intelligence - The ability to use mathematics or deductive reasoning to solve problems.
- Spatial intelligence - The ability to form mental model of the spatial world
- Musical intelligence - The ability to create music
- Bodily/kinesthetic intelligence - The ability to use motor skills to solve problems
- Interpersonal intelligence - The ability to understand other people
- Intrapersonal intelligence - The ability to understand one's self
- Naturalistic intelligence - The ability to understand the outside world

Different people have different strengths and weaknesses. Just because someone's struggling, doesn't mean that they don't have other strengths.
